=====
The Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) protocol combines various NAT traversal utilities such as the STUN and TURN protocols in order to offer a powerful mechanism that allows Offer/Answer based protocols such as SIP and XMPP to traverse NATs.

This project provides a Java implementation of the ICE protocol that would be usable by both SIP and XMPP applications. The project also provides features such as socket sharing.

ice4j is maintained by the [Jitsi](https://jitsi.org/) community. Use Jitsi's [community forum](https://community.jitsi.org) for questions and discussions.

## Pseudo TCP
The pseudo TCP implementation was moved it its own [project](https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-pseudotcp).
